Project Outline:

Data Acquisition:
a. Fetch vulnerability data from the chosen database (NVD, CVE, etc.).
b. Parse and store the vulnerability information in a structured format.

Network Scanning:
a. Install and import the Nmap or Scapy libraries.
b. Define the target network or web application to scan.
c. Perform the network scan using Nmap or Scapy.
d. Extract information about operating systems, services, and applications.

Vulnerability Matching:
a. Create a function to match identified services and applications with vulnerability data.
b. Check for potential vulnerabilities based on software versions and vulnerability information.
c. Utilize libraries like Safety or Dependency Checker for dependency analysis and vulnerability identification.

Vulnerability Reporting:
a. Design a report structure to include vulnerability details, severity levels, and remediation steps.
b. Generate reports for identified vulnerabilities, prioritizing them based on severity.
c. Present the reports in a clear and organized manner.

Continuous Monitoring:
a. Implement a scheduling mechanism for regular scans.
b. Automate the scanning and reporting process using cron jobs or similar tools.
c. Continuously monitor the target network or web application for new vulnerabilities.
